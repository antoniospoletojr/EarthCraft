# EarthCraft
EarthCraft is a deep learning based terrain renderer built as part of an academic assignment,  and written in C++/Python and legacy OpenGL (no GLSL). The renderer transforms 2D sketches into beautiful 3D landscapes and its neural engine was built following and re-implementing the research study "Interactive Example-Based Terrain Authoring with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks".
