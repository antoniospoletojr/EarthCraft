*a modest, small, homemade, partially deprecated and obsolete prototype of a terrain renderer using deep learning*

## The project

EarthCraft is a deep learning based terrain renderer built as part of an academic assignment,  and written in C++/Python and legacy OpenGL (no GLSL). The renderer transforms 2D sketches into beautiful 3D landscapes and its neural engine was built following and re-implementing the research study "Interactive Example-Based Terrain Authoring with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks".
This project was not developed with portability in mind and no ready to use executables were produced. In order to run this code make sure to have the required included libs in the makefile. A python env is also required; my python packages are listed in the "environment.yml" file.
